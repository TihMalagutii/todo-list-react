# To Do List
> ReactJS

This project is a web application developed with React for creating and managing task lists, known as "to-do lists". The application offers an intuitive and responsive user interface, allowing users to efficiently add, edit, and remove tasks from their lists.

An important feature of this project is the ability to organize tasks by categories or tags, facilitating the visualization and management of different types of tasks. Additionally, users have the option to mark tasks as completed, which helps to keep track of progress and pending activities.

The project also includes data persistence features, allowing task lists to be saved and loaded again on subsequent visits to the application. This ensures a seamless experience for users, without the loss of data between sessions.
